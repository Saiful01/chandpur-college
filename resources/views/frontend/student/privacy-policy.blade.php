                <h5> Privacy Policy Promise</h5>
                <p>
                    While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important
                    asset is our clients’ trust. Keeping client information secure, and using it only as our clients
                    would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at Chandpur Government College . Here then, is our
                    promise to our individual visitors:

                    We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information
                    our visitors share with us.
                    We will limit the collection and use of visitor information to the minimum we require to deliver
                    superior service to our visitors. Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be
                    subject to our normal disciplinary process.
                    We will not reveal visitor information to any external organization unless we have previously
                    informed the visitor in disclosures or agreements, or are required by law.
                    We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our visitor information.
                    Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to
                    our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.
                    We will attempt to keep visitor files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We will tell our
                    visitors how and where to conveniently access their information (except when we’re prohibited by
                    law) and how to notify us about errors which we will promptly correct.
